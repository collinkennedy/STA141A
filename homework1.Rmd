## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# 1 **Vectors and Simulations**
- **a)** *Generate random samples with replacement of size 100 from each of the types. Call the resulting vectors of character strings as: Animal, Color, Attribute (1 point).*

```{r question1a}
animals = c("cat","dog","cow","squirrel")
colors = c("white","black","brown","red")
attr = c("big","small","angry","cute", "finicky")

Animal = sample(animals,100, replace = TRUE)
Color = sample(colors,100,replace= TRUE)
Attribute = sample(attr,100,replace = TRUE)
Animal
Color
Attribute

```

- **b)** *Compute how many animals in the sample are cats or dogs (1 point).*
```{r question1b}
count = 0
for(anim in Animal){
  if (anim == "cat" | anim == "dog"){
    count = count + 1
  }
}
count
```

- **c)** *Write R code to combine the results to produce phrases (character strings) describing the animals as in this example: big white dog (2 points).*
```{r question1c}
#attribute color animal
listOfVecs = list(attr, colors, animals)
randomPhraseVector = c()
for(vector in listOfVecs){
  appendWord = sample(vector,1)
  randomPhraseVector = append(randomPhraseVector,appendWord)
  
}
paste(randomPhraseVector)
```

- **d)** *Create a contingency table between Animal and Attribute (1 point).*
```{r question1d}
library(dplyr)
contingTable = table(Animal,Attribute)
contingTable
```

# **2 Matrices**
- **a)** *Create the matrix A and the vector y corresponding to the matrix equation Ax=y,where A∈ℝ5×5 and x,y∈ℝ5 (1 point).*
```{r question2a}
A = matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,
             2,1,2,3,4,
             3,2,1,2,3,
             4,3,2,1,2,
             5,4,3,2,1),5,5,byrow = TRUE)

A

y = c(7,-1,-3,5,17)
```

- **b)** *Determine if the matrix A is invertible (2 points).*
```{r question2b}
if(det(A)!=0){
  print("Matrix A is invertible")
  
}else{
  print("The matrix is NOT invertible")
}


```

- **c)** *Find the solution of the system of linear equations (2 points).*
```{r question2c}
solve(A,y)

#or
colnames(A) <- paste0('x', 1:5)

solve(A) %*% y

```

- **d)** *Verify that your solution is correct (1 point).*

## **3 Data Exploration**
```{r question3}
#load data
load("/Users/collinkennedy/Google Drive/Programming Folder (4Transfer to Collin's Files V2)/R/STA141A/countypop.RData")

```

**a)** *How many unique 2-letter state abbreviations are there (1 point)?*
```{r question3a}
vecOfAbbrevs <- unique(countypop$abbr)
length(vecOfAbbrevs)

```
there are 51 unique abbreviations (this makes sense since the data includes DC)


**b)** *What is the total number of counties in the US (1 point)?*
```{r question 3b}
length(countypop$county)


```
There are 3142 counties in the US.

**c)** *How many unique county names are there (1 point)?*
```{r question 3c}
vecOfUniqueCounties = unique(countypop$county)
length(vecOfUniqueCounties)


```
There are 1877 *unique* county names.

**d)** *What are the top 10 most common county names (2 points)?*
```{r question 3d}
countyFreq <- as.data.frame(table(countypop$county))
countyFreq = countyFreq %>% arrange(desc(Freq))
#top 10 most common county names:
countyFreq[1:10,]

```


**e)** *Which state has the largest number of counties? Which state has the smallest number of counties (1 points)?*
```{r question 3e}
countyAbbr <- as.data.frame(table(countypop$abbr))
countyAbbr  = countyAbbr %>% arrange(desc(Freq))
countyAbbr 

```
Texas has the most counties (254), while Delaware has the fewest (3).


**f)** *What is the average population of a county in the US (1 point)?*
```{r question 3f}
mean(countypop$pop_2015)

```

**g)** *Which state has the largest county in terms of population? How many people live in the largest county in terms of population (2 points)?*
```{r question 3g}

subDF = countypop %>% arrange(desc(pop_2015))
state = subDF$abbr[1]
#which state
state

#the population in the largest county in that state
pop = subDF$pop_2015[1]
pop

```


**h)** *What is the largest county in terms of population of each of the states (2 points)?*
```{r question 3h}
hDF2 = countypop %>%
  group_by(abbr) %>%
  filter(abbr != "DC") %>% 
  slice(which.max(pop_2015)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(pop_2015)) %>% #slice selects rows by position->in this case
  print(n=50)                         #it chooses the greatest population value of each county
                            #since we are grouping by State (abbr)




```

**i)** *What is the average population of the 100 largest counties in the US (2 points)?*
```{r question 3i}
countyPopByPop = countypop %>% arrange(desc(pop_2015))
mean(countyPopByPop$pop_2015[1:100])

```



**j)** *How many people live in each of the states (2 points)?*
```{r question 3j}
totalPopDF = group_by(countypop, abbr) %>% 
  summarize(totalPopulation = sum(pop_2015)) %>%
  filter(abbr != "DC") %>% 
  arrange(desc(totalPopulation))
print(totalPopDF, n= 50)

```



**k)** *What is the average population of a county in California (2 points)?*
```{r question 3k}
caliDF = countypop %>% filter(abbr == "CA")
#average population of a county in California:
mean(caliDF$pop_2015)

```



**l)** *What is the average population of a county in each of the states (2 points)?*
```{r question 3l}
meanPopDF = group_by(countypop, abbr) %>% 
  summarize(meanPopulationOfACounty = mean(pop_2015)) %>%
  filter(abbr != "DC") %>% 
  arrange(desc(meanPopulationOfACounty))
print(meanPopDF, n= 50)

```
