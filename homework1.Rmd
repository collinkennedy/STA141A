## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# 1 **Vectors and Simulations**
- **a)** *Generate random samples with replacement of size 100 from each of the types. Call the resulting vectors of character strings as: Animal, Color, Attribute (1 point).*

```{r question1a}
animals = c("cat","dog","cow","squirrel")
colors = c("white","black","brown","red")
attr = c("big","small","angry","cute", "finicky")

Animal = sample(animals,100, replace = TRUE)
Color = sample(colors,100,replace= TRUE)
Attribute = sample(attr,100,replace = TRUE)
Animal
Color
Attribute

```

- **b)** *Compute how many animals in the sample are cats or dogs (1 point).*
```{r question1b}
count = 0
for(anim in Animal){
  if (anim == "cat" | anim == "dog"){
    count = count + 1
  }
}
count
```

- **c)** *Write R code to combine the results to produce phrases (character strings) describing the animals as in this example: big white dog (2 points).*
```{r question1c}
#attribute color animal
listOfVecs = list(attr, colors, animals)
randomPhraseVector = c()
for(vector in listOfVecs){
  appendWord = sample(vector,1)
  randomPhraseVector = append(randomPhraseVector,appendWord)
  
}
paste(randomPhraseVector)
```

- **d)** *Create a contingency table between Animal and Attribute (1 point).*
```{r question1d}
library(dplyr)
contingTable = table(Animal,Attribute)
contingTable
```

# **2 Matrices**
- **a)** *Create the matrix A and the vector y corresponding to the matrix equation Ax=y,where A∈ℝ5×5 and x,y∈ℝ5 (1 point).*
```{r question2a}
A = matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,
             2,1,2,3,4,
             3,2,1,2,3,
             4,3,2,1,1,
             5,4,3,2,1),5,5,byrow = TRUE)

A

y = c(7,-1,3,5,17)
```

```{r question2b}


```
